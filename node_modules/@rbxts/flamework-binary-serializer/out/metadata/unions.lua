-- Compiled with roblox-ts v2.3.0
-- This type allows us to detect types like `number & Marker` or `15 & Marker` correctly,
-- by mapping the object portion of `T` onto `V`.
-- This type finds all literal keys and excludes union keys.
-- This type excludes discriminators that don't exist in every constituent.
-- This type excludes discriminators whose values are not unique between all constituents.
-- This doesn't check whether T is a union, only that it is comprised of only literal values.
-- The literal metadata will check for non-unions itself to optimize single literal values into zero bytes.
-- We also exclude plain `boolean` here as that has a more efficient special case.
