# What is ZLib, Why should you use it?
Zlib is a library is used for compressing strings. Mainly used for optimizing datastores. Outclasses [squash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/squash) when compressing strings for datastores. This package is **not made by me**, I just wanted to upload this into @rbxts so I can use this for roblox-ts
